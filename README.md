Project 2 - Extending the JWKS Server

// This is an extension of P1's creation of a basic JWKS Server. //

// P2 Primarily focuses on the creation of a SQL Database to store //

// and manage the JWK and JWT. //

This project requires GCC to be installed! Make sure you have any C-compiler installed too

Run this program using

go run .

OR

go run auth.go main.go keys.go.

Test Client

Make sure you run the test client on a separate IDE or Terminal instance!

go run test.go

I apologize if this should be in one file, it wasn't specified if it should all be contained within one file or not. I usually do multiple files as having everything within one main file is messy and doesn't make sense.

If it needs to be in one file, I can gladly reupload this with all the code within one file!
